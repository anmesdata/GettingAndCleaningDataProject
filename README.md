## Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This repository contains the required submissions for the JHU Data Science Getting and Cleaning Data Project.

# Introduction

This aim of this project is to depict the ability to collect, work with and clean a data set so that it ready for further analysis.
The data used in this project explores Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones. 
A full description of the data can be found at
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

# Project Instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
